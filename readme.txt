Restricts purchases to only one product per user per lifetime. Configurable.

== Description ==
If you want to limit the purchases of certain products, or all products on the site to a maximum of 1 copy per user, then using this plugin you can set this limit. In the settings of each product, an option will be available to limit the purchase of goods by one person, which is important when selling information products, or digital products with a limited number.

When trying to re-order a product, the user will receive an error that he has already purchased this product before and already has access to it. Also, when you first purchase a product, the maximum quantity will be limited to 1 unit. You can also set this limit for all products on your site through the plugin settings.
